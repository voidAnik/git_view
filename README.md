- A search mechanism has been added for different key search. But not fully done.

## Design Pattern & Architectures
- The full Modelâ€”Viewâ€”ViewModel (MVVM) Pattern has been used.
- Dagger Hilt has been used for Dependency Injection.
- For API calling Retrofit2 has been used.
- API BASE_URL & END_POINTS are securely saved in BuildConfig.
- Central & manual access_token system is added for token based API (Just the structure has been made).
- Retry mechanism has been added when the API fails. And it retries for maximum 3 times.
- New Refreshed data is being fetched every 30 minutes. For that periodic Thread has been used.

## Future Scope

- I made a search mechanism but couldn't finish due to lack of time. It can be implemented for other queries.
- For pagination It's better to use Paging 3. To finish the project in time I have used manual pagination.
